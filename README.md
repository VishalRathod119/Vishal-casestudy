**Shoes price prediction**

**Objective:**
Predicting shoes price for the customers of Zshoes and deploy with the help of flask.

**Problem Statement:**<br>
Zshoes.com is one of the famous shoe manufacturers of India and has business in
almost every country in Asia and Europe. They are one of the best choices of all the
athletics and they make the best shoes for running. Due to pandemic, they are facing a
loss as Zshoes are a bit expensive. They want to know the correct price of all types of
shoes that they are manufacturing so that they wonâ€™t face any loss and at the same
time customers also buy the shoes. As a machine learning engineer, we have to build a
shoe-price prediction app that can predict the correct shoe price by taking inputs like
freight_value,payment_type, etc.

**Feature Details:**<br>
**order_item_id:** Order id of the shoe,<br>
**price:** price of the shoe(Target),<br>
**freight_value:** freight_value of the shoe,<br>
**payment_sequential:** Sequence of payment,<br>
**payment_type:** types of payment,<br>
**payment_installments:** Installments of payments,<br>
**payment_value:** Value of payment,<br>

**Skills and technique used:**<br>
Python,<br>
EDA,<br>
Machine Learning algorithms,<br>
Visual Analysis,<br>

**Libraries used:**<br>
Pandas,<br>
Numpy,<br>
Seaborn,<br>
Matplotlib,<br>
Sklearn,

**Outcome:**<br>
Out of all machine learning algorith i choose Random forest as best optimal model and Go with Random Forest model for Shoe price prediction.
